          Based in Tuscon, Arizona, Lucky Shrub is a medium-sized garden design
          firm that specializes in garden design and creation, maintenance and
          landscaping. The company also runs a small plant nursery that sells
          indoor and outdoor plants, making them a one-stop shop for clients to
          "transform any space into an oasis you can be proud of".

          Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason and Maria,

          He creates and oversees all designs while managing his team of
          landscapers. Maria manages all the marketing for the company and
